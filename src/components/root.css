/**
 * A bit of cruft in here to deal with various browsers, etc. so the cruft has
 * been annotated with the corresponding :bug:
 *
 * @see https://github.com/philipwalton/solved-by-flexbox/blob/master/assets/css/components/site.css
 *
 * 1. Avoid the IE 10-11 `min-height` bug.
 * 2. Set `flex-shrink` to `0` to prevent some browsers from
 *    letting these items shrink to smaller than their content's default
 *    minimum size. See http://bit.ly/1Mn35US for details.
 * 3. Use `%` instead of `vh` since `vh` is buggy in older mobile Safari.
