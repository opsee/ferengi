        <h2 className="text-accent">Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Clouds are replacing datacenters, containers are replacing VMs, and microservices are replacing monolithic applications. Independent microservices help engineering organizations break free of the quarterly release cycle and ship small increments of functionality every single day. There&rsquo;s a cost, though. What once ran in a single process now spans multiple machines, and unreliable infrastructure can add new failure modes between you and your users.</p>
        <p>Now, more than ever, application developers are being asked to own the availability of their code. We&rsquo;re here to help.</p>
